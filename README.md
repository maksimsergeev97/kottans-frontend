# kottans-frontend
### Hi, kottans! I`m Max :wave:
This is my ReadMe file where I'll be sharing my progress with the interface course from the wonderful [Cottans!](https://kottans.org/ "kottans.org")<br>
**Let's go!**
## 0. Git and GitHub
0.1 Very interesting information about Git from the video course [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github)<br>
I was familiar with the basic principles and commands of Git, but learned a lot of interesting information about the capabilities of Git and new commands from the course.<br>

### learngitbranching.js.org
0.2 Completed levels at [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org)<br>
Interesting tasks, cool interface, sometimes it was difficult and did not work the first time.<br>

## 1. Linux CLI, and HTTP
[1_Quiz](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/9920c6191cf2f6355a3e1bdc777babcf792f5912/task_linux_cli/quiz_1.PNG)

1.1 Linux is a very powerful operating system that, in my opinion, every IT professional should be familiar with. The information in the course [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction) is presented in a very clear and convenient way. I used to come across basic linux commands like cd, ls, mv, cp, rm, chmod. Therefore, it was not difficult for me to pass this course, but the commands for working with the printer (lpq and lprm) and working with OS processes (ps, aux and kill) were new and very interesting for me. I hope one day I will have the opportunity to delve deeper into working with the Linux OS, and I think I will need all these commands.<br>
### HTTP: A protocol that every web developer should understand
1.2 Before this course I was familiar with the basics of HTTP and HTTPS as I have a background in system administration, but these 2 articles [HTTP: A Protocol Every Web Developer Should Understand - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) and [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155) gave me a deeper understanding of how these protocols work. There is a lot of information and it is sometimes difficult to understand, but very useful! I believe that every developer, no matter front-end or back-end, should understand all the intricacies of these protocols. I was very interested in the chapter on identification and authentication, it was interesting to learn how sites can access user data.<br><br>
Knowing that working with GET and POST requests is one of the main tasks of a frontend developer, so it is very useful to understand what we can send to the server and what we can receive from the server using these requests. Therefore, this information will be used when creating the logic of the operation of elements of sites or applications with the server.<br>
## 2. Git Collaboration
[Screenshot 3 week](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/792dc8dcdd72b0ba1f60d07d1de176c1c00d88ee/task_git_collaboration/Git_week_3.PNG)<br>

2.1 Lessons from weeks 3 and 4 of the course [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) are as interesting as the lessons of the previous weeks. Very good explanation of how to work with GitHub. A lot of new information, for me, almost all the commands from these lessons were unknown to me before, but now, as soon as I have the opportunity to work in a team with git and github, I will use all the knowledge to the fullest :)<br>
In the course, I really enjoyed the section on Git practices while working in a team. Now I know how to properly usage Git. Features like Forking and Pull request opened up a different side of GitHub for me. Never thought GitHub was such a powerful thing, thanks Kottans for new discoveries!<br>
### learngitbranching.js.org 
2.2 An interesting site with exercises to understand how git works and learn the git commands [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org)<br>
In the "Remote Repositories" section, there were some tasks that required sitting, thinking and resetting several times ))) But the info from the course and the previews with the info before the task are enough to complete everything, without help from the outside<br>
[Screenshot of the main levels](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/792dc8dcdd72b0ba1f60d07d1de176c1c00d88ee/task_git_collaboration/git_base.PNG)<br>

## 3. Intro to HTML and CSS
3.1 HTML and CSS are well known to me, I have been studying them together with JS for a year, so all the topics from the lessons were clear and did not cause any difficulties. The only thing new to me is the non-breaking space and its \&nbsp; Maybe someday I'll need it :)<br>
[Screenshot 1 week](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/8cfe7039a6075289557471a72907dabf578eb296/task_html_css_intro/HTML_CSS_week_1.PNG)<br>[Screenshot 2 week](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/8cfe7039a6075289557471a72907dabf578eb296/task_html_css_intro/HTML_CSS_week_2.PNG)<br><br>
3.2 When performing tasks with Codecademy, there were no difficulties. Everything is clear and simple. But I want to note that a very good database of information and interactive training, like on codecademy, gives a good understanding and principles of HTML and CSS<br>
Here, patterns and regular expressions when validating input were new to me . Interesting information and in simple projects it can be used. Also the html \<embed> tag, I forgot about it, thanks for reminding me!<br>

## 4. Responsive Web Design
4.1 [Responsive web design basics](https://web.dev/i18n/en/responsive-web-design-basics) - Interesting information about the basic concepts of responsive layout. I have experience with flex and grid and media queries, so this was nothing new to me. But was surprised by the opportunity to discover media query breakpoints in Chrome DevTools.<br><br>
4.2 [FLEXBOX. Вчимося верстати на флексах](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG5mPV60dMmjMRrHVW4LmV2x) and [CSS Grid Layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV92IdMGFfA&list=PLM6XATa8CAG5pXQrW_kDaeZb_uIAMNZIm) - informative video tutorials about flexbox and grid layout. Everything you need to know about these tools is described. An interesting concept of building the entire structure of the site using flex or grids. I will read how it is used in practice and will use it if so!<br>
The flex-flow and order properties were new to me, and the span attribute (when positioning grids) had never used them before.<br><br>
4.3 [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/) - very cool games to consolidate the viewed material! Cool interface and interesting puzzles!<br>
[Screenshot Flexbox Froggy](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/09d6fa999474f26f3fd6f59db3a6e4caf8cd8004/task_responsive_web_design/Screenshot_flex_froggy.PNG) and [Screenshot Grid Garden](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/09d6fa999474f26f3fd6f59db3a6e4caf8cd8004/task_responsive_web_design/Screenshot_grid_garden.PNG)<br>
## 5. HTML & CSS Practice: Hooli-style Popup
Interesting experience of creating a dropdown list without using JS :)<br>
[Demo](https://maksimsergeev97.github.io/Hooli-style-popup) | [Code base](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/Hooli-style-popup)<br>
## 6. JS Basics
6.1 [Screenshot 4 week](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/Coursera_week_4.PNG) - all the topics from js basics were familiar to me. Very useful basics of the language, for beginners<br>
### FreeCodeCamp
6.2 All freeCodeCamp tasks were incredibly useful, very interesting, sometimes confusing and difficult :) Thanks for giving me the opportunity to solve them!
[Basic JavaScript](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/freecodecamp-1.PNG) - the first 100 tasks were completed without much difficulty.<br><br>
[ES6 Challenges](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/freecodecamp-2.PNG) - interesting practical information about using the ES6 standard.<br> 
[Basic Data Structures](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/freecodecamp-5.PNG) - understanding the basics of working with arrays and objects is very important for beginners.<br>
[Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/freecodecamp-6.PNG) - some tasks were more difficult and it was very interesting to solve them.<br>
[Functional Programming](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/freecodecamp-7.PNG) - learned about the concept of functional programming. Very important information.<br>
[Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_basics/freecodecamp-8.PNG) - coolest tasks! Some were solved in 5 minutes, some had to sweat for hours :)
It's good to have hints :)<br>
## 7. DOM
7.1 [Screenshot 5 week](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_dom/Coursera_week_5.PNG) - all the information about the DOM, from the course, was familiar to me. I find it very convenient to use document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll.<br>
7.2 [Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/kottans-frontend/blob/main/task_js_dom/freecodecamp-8.PNG) - as I wrote above, some of these tasks were difficult and took a lot of time, sometimes I had to look at hints.<br>
7.3 An interesting practical task, used a json file as a database :)<br>
[Demo](https://maksimsergeev97.github.io/JS-DOM-Practice) | [Code base](https://github.com/maksimsergeev97/JS-DOM-Practice)<br>
